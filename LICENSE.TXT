JAVA LGPL CLARIFICATION
-----------------------
JSAP is Free Software. The LGPL license is sufficiently
flexible to allow the use of JSAP in both open source
and commercial projects. Using JSAP (by importing JSAP's
public interfaces in your Java code), and extending JSAP
(by subclassing) are considered by the authors of JSAP
to be dynamic linking. Hence our interpretation of the
LGPL is that the use of the unmodified JSAP or binary does
not affect the license of your application code.

If you modify JSAP and redistribute your modifications,
the LGPL applies.
